|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Session-Based Login Bypass Logic
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Author: Ben
|
| Description:
| ------------
| This PHP script attempts to optimize user login by allowing a password 
| bypass if the user has logged in recently (within the last 30 minutes).
| It connects to a MySQL database, conditionally skips re-authentication,
| and updates the session timestamp.
|
| Functionality:
| --------------
| - Starts a session to track login time.
| - Defines a function `canBypassPassword()` that checks if the last 
|   login was within 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
| - If bypass is allowed, it connects to the database without running a query.
| - Otherwise, it authenticates with a SQL query and updates the session time.
|
| Security Notes:
| ---------------
| - This logic assumes session fixation and hijacking are mitigated.
| - Password bypass should only be used in secure environments.
| - Hardcoded credentials should be avoided in production.
|
| Requirements:
| -------------
| - A valid MySQL server running with test data in the `test` table.
| - PHP session support enabled.
